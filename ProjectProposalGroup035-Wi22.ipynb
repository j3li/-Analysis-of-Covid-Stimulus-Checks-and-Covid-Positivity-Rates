    "### INTRO:\n",
    "*The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on the economy, with many people losing their jobs. Similar to previous recessions, the US government provided stimulus checks in hopes of boosting the economy and also assisting people with buying protective equipment, such as masks and disinfectants. In our study, we are trying to determine whether the stimulus checks have had a positive effect (negative correlation) on covid infection rates.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### PRIOR WORK:\n",
    "*There are few studies on the effects of the government grants that relate to covid infection rates; however, there is an article about an increase in isolation and compliance due to government grants. In 2020, a survey was conducted where they asked Americans if they would comply with an extension of stay-at-home orders. They found that about half of Americans would comply and a third wouldn’t. Moreover, they discovered that economically secure people are more likely to stay at home in isolation, while those who aren’t secure would be less likely to stay home because they had to go to work. Since the government passed 3 COVID-19 stimulus checks, along with unemployment benefits from the CARE Act, people felt more financially secure, thus more likely to stay in isolation.*\n",

    "*Upon our research, we hypothesized that there is a negative correlation between the stimulus checks/covid grants and covid infections rates across the counties of California. We believe this is the case because people will be able to support some of their bare necessities while staying isolated which will keep others safe and prevent exposure.*"
